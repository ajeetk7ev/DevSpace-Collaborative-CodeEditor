# 🚀 DevSpace - Collaborative Code Editor

**DevSpace** is a powerful, full-stack **real-time collaborative code editor** built using modern web technologies like **Next.js 15 (App Router)**, **Monaco Editor**, **TailwindCSS**, and **WebSockets**. It empowers developers, students, and teams to **collaborate on code in real-time**, execute it in the browser using the **Judge0 API**, and visualize **output, errors, and runtime statistics** — all within a clean, responsive interface.

> Think of it as a real-time coding environment like Replit or CodePen, but with room-based collaboration, language switching, and a personal dev playground — open-source and extensible.

## 🔥 Features

- 🧑‍💻 **Real-time Collaborative Code Editing**  
  Collaborate with friends or team members in the same coding room via WebSocket-powered live syncing.

- 🧠 **Monaco Editor**  
  The same editor that powers VS Code. Enjoy syntax highlighting, autocomplete, error markers, and IntelliSense.

  Execute code using Judge0 API and instantly receive output — works with over 10 popular languages.

- 📥 **Custom Input Support (stdin)**  
  Pass standard input data to your code for more interactive programs.

- 📊 **Execution Stats**  
  View how long your code took to run and how much memory it consumed.

- 🐞 **Error Highlighting & Line Tracking**  
  Judge0’s response is parsed to point you to the exact line and error in your code.

- 🛠️ **Language Selector with Boilerplate Snippets**  
  Switch between JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C++, Java, Go, and more with default templates auto-filled.

- 👥 **Room-Based Collaboration**  
  Easily join or share rooms with peers and code together live — great for interviews, teaching, or pair programming.

- ⏳ **Run Button with Loader**  
  Visual feedback while your code executes — loader shows on the run button until Judge0 responds.
